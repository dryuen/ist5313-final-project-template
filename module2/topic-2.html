<p>This is a great way to try new wines without investing in a whole bottle. 
The following is a top list of what to do and what not to do when hosting.</p>

<P><strong>Do's of Hosting</strong></P>
 
<p><strong>1. DO find out the format.</strong></p>
 
<p>Decide if it will be an informal walk-around tasting or whether people will be seated at a table with 
a structured presentation and order. It mainly depends on the personality of the audience.</p>
 
<p><strong>2. DO take notes.</strong></p>
 
<p>It’s a good idea to take notes on the appearance, smell, taste, and overall conclusion of the wine. 
It may seem difficult at first but by making it a habit it will soon become much easier.</p>
 
<p><strong>3. DO try something new.</strong></p>
 
<p>Don’t be afraid to try something new. This is a perfect time to leave your hesitations at the door and 
try a wine that you normally wouldn’t.</p>
 
<p><strong>4. DO swallow if you want to.</strong></p>
 
<p>There is a great debate as to whether to spit or swallow. 
Either is acceptable. Don’t be afraid to spit out something that does not suit your taste buds. 
And feel free to savior one you really enjoy.</p>
 
 
<p><strong>5. Ask questions.</strong></p>
 
<p>Always feel free to ask questions about the wine. 
A good host will be informative and willing to help out in any situation.</p>
 
<p><strong>6. DO cleanse your palate.</strong><p>

<P><strong> Dont's of Hosting</strong></P>
 
<p><strong>1. Don’t be afraid to take a sip of water between tastings or nibble on a cracker.</strong></p>
<p>They are there to enhance the tastings.</p>
 
   
<p><strong>2. DON’T be afraid to give your opinion.</strong></p>
 
<p>It definitely matters. Each person has a different taste so there is no right or wrong answer.</p> 
 
<p><strong>3. DON'T knock it back.</strong></p>
 
<p>There’s more to wine tasting that drinking.</p>
<p>Remember these 4 easy steps:</p>
<p>1) Look - Check out the color and clarity. Be specific.</p>
<p>2) Swirl – Slow and easy. When you swirl, the more droplets of wine that cling to the inside of 
the glass indicate a higher alcohol content.</p>
<P>3) Smell - Bring it up to your nose for a second impression and take in the aroma.</P>
<P>4) Sip - Let it roll around your mouth. Don’t gulp.</P>
 
<p><strong>4. DON’T hold the bowl.</strong></p>
 
<p>It’s best to hold the glass by the stem. 
This will reduce fingerprints and also won’t affect the temperature.</p>
 
<p><strong>5. DON’T go on an empty stomach.</strong></p>
 
<p>Always have something to eat before going. Those many small sips can quickly add up.</p>
