         			<p>Example 1: Guided Practice</p>
         			<p>In this first example, we will show you step-by-step how to 
         			use elimination to solve a system of equations.</p>
         			<p>[ Video ]</p>
         			<p>When you have two equations that are in standard form instead of 
         			slope-intercept form, like the ones in this example, it is often easier to 
         			solve the system of equations using the elimination method instead of tables
         			or graphing.</p> 
         			<p>To start solving you want to make sure that the two equations are lined up: 
         			x over x, y over y, and constant over constant. Our goal is to be able to add 
         			the equations straight down and have one of the variables cancel out. For this 
         			example, I'm going to have the x's cancel out.  In order for the x terms to 
         			cancel out, I need both of them to have the same value but opposite signs. Since
         			the second equation already has a positive 2x, if I can make the top equation
         			have a negative 2x then If I add those two terms they will cancel out to be 0.
         			So what I'm going to do is multiply the entire top equation by -2.  I'll
         			distribute -2 to all three terms of the equation. I get -2x. -2 times +3 would
         			be -6y, equals. -2 times +11 is -22.</p>
         			<p>Next I'm going to rewrite the second equation below. Now if I add these two
         			equations straight down, I see that my x's will cancel out because -2 plus +2
         			is 0. I'm going to mark it out.</p>
         			<p>Let's add the other terms. -6y plus -4y would be -10y, equals. On the right
         			hand side we have -22 plus -18 which is -40. Now we have a simple equation of 
         			-10y equals -40. It just takes one step to solve it. I would divide both sides
         			by -10 to get y by itself. That leaves me with y equals +4.</p>
         			<p>Now that we know the value of y, we can find the value of x by plugging in the
         			y value into one of the equations. I'm going to substitute 4 in place of y in
         			that first equation and solve for x.</p>
         			<p>Here I've rewritten the first equation but I've replaced the y with a 4. Now 
         			we're ready to solve for x. The first thing you need to do is multiply 3 and 4.
         			That would give me x plus 12 equals 11. There's just one more step to solve for
         			x. Since it's a +12, I will need to subtract 12 from both sides. That leaves me
         			with x equals -1.</p>
         			<p>To write our final answer we plug in the x value and the y value into a
         			coordinate point. So the solution to this system of equations is (-1,4).</p>
