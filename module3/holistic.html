				<li>Move your body in a way you enjoy. Take advantage of local parks and go hiking, ride a bike, or anything else available in your area.</li>
				<li>Eat well, simply. Nutrition can seem complicated as a result of fade diets that come and go every few months, but it needn't be. Eat a variety of fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds, beans and legumes, diary, eggs, fish and seafood, and meat and poultry. Make eating fruits and vegetables a high priority, stop eating once you're satisfied but not stuffed, enjoy your favorite not-super-healthy foods on occassions.</li>
				<li>Focus on the lifestyle, not the goal. The journey is the destination. Strive to make eating well and moving your body in an enjoyable way part of your daily life. Enjoy the journey and additional results will follow.</li>
