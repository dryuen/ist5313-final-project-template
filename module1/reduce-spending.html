                <p>VIDEO HERE!!!! I will make a video of several ways to reduce spending. I’m going to use Powtoons to make it hopefully somewhere around  3 - 5 minutes long. Examples of ways not to spend will be: Eating out at restaurants ,Starbucks/dunkin donuts, Hobbies like Golf, New Clothing, Buying movie tickets, video games etc. Much like the extra expenses for the NO spend challenge slide.</p>
                </div>
                <p>The idea of minimalism budgeting is to become a conscious consumer - thinking through your purchases, saved and spent. What is coming in and what is coming out. Think through every purchase before you leave the house. Keep a planner to write down the things you spend on. Make a list of what you need and stick to it. If it's not on your list don't buy it! You originally didn't need it. Get rid of “last minute” purchases. </p>

                <p>Instead of going out often, invite friends over and cook at home. The psychology of eating out is to enjoy company with friends. Why pay for all of that when you can spend it at home and make it more memorable? Eating out at a restaurant for one person averages to about 20 - 25 dollars for a meal and a drink. An individual would spend a total of $1,000 - $1,250 a year on eating out! Now imagine if you could limit this to once every 2 weeks? That's about twice a month. The total drastically decreases to $300 a year. </p>


                <p>If you are already subscribed to entertainment services like Netflix, Hulu or Xbox live, consider cancelling the services if you barely use them and could live without them. If you do not game online on a Xbox for more than 3 hours, then it probably is not worth to keep. If you do however use a subscription like Netflix, then cut down the rips you make to the movie theaters. A netflix subscription is about $12 a month. That’s $144 a year. Now if we compare that to watching a movie once a week at the movie theater, one ticket averages to $10. That is about $40 dollars a month, and come to a yearly total of about $500 a year for one person. That’s without including extra tickets for your significant other or children, and without popcorn and drinks which could double the amount you spend a week. If there is a movie you really want to watch consider waiting a few weeks before watching it when ticket costs come down and watch the matinees which are a few dollars cheaper than regular tickets.</p>
