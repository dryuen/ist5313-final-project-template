					Vitis vinifera otherwise known as the wine grape is used to make wine. 
					There are over 1,000 varieties of wine grapes and they are a lot smaller 
					than the ones we may buy at the grocery store. 
					We will go over some common Red and White wines made from some of these grapes.
					
					<br/><br/>
					Red wines, in taste, range from very dry to sweet. The fab four red wines are:
 					<br/><br/>
 					
 					<ul>
						<li>Cabernet Sauvignon is one of the most popular wines is one that comes from the Bourdeaux region of France. 
						The taste of black cherry, currants and spice, with oak has given the “cab” its popularity and claim to fame.</li>
						<br/>
						<li>Syrah/Shiraz tastes of berries like blueberry, blackberry, plum, and pepper. This wine is grown mostly 
						in the Rhone Valley of France and Australia.</li>
						<br/>
						<li>Zinfandel is native to California and is made with a collection of fruits like raspberry, overripe cherry, 
						blackberry, prunes or raisins and has a spicy finish from the Asian spices and tobacco.</li>
						<br/>
						<li>Pinot Noir is susceptible to its environment, which is the reason for it’s earthy and “vegetal” flavors of 
						beet and mushroom. Pinot noir also has a fruity taste of cherry, cranberry, and plum with floral notes.</li>
					</ul>
					
					
					<br/><br/>
					White wines are the colorless wines made from white and yellow grapes or red grapes whose skins have been removed. 
					White wines are much lighter than red wines and are great for warm weather. They are know for their sweet and crisp taste.
 					<br/><br/>
 					
 					<ul>
						<li>Chardonnays can be smooth, buttery, and toasty with tastes of green apple, tropical fruits like, pineapple and papayas. 
						Chardonnay is originally from the Burgundy region of France. </li>    
					<br/>
						<li>Sauvignon Blanc is an incredibly tart and citrus forward with grapefruit creating a bit of a bitter taste, 
						combined with honeydew melon, kiwi, pineapple, peach and herbaceous flavors of grass and pepper. Sauvignon Blanc is 
						also associated with the cabernet sauvignon.</li>  
      				<br/>
						<li>Pinot Grigio is light and crisp with a strong taste of pear.  The vines are primarily planted in Italy but can be found 
						in France and Germany as well.</li>  
					<br/>
						<li>Rieslings can range in flavor from floral and sweet to stony and dry. Rieslings are made with a variety of citrus and 
						stone fruits like limes and lemons along with apricot and peaches. The  Mosel-Saar-Ruwer, Rheinhessen and Rheingau 
						regions of Germany are home to many exceptional Rieslings. </li>  
					</ul>
					
					<br/><br/>
					The pink wines are known as Roses. Roses are made by letting the red grape skins touch the wine for just a couple hours or until it has reached the 
					optimum pink color. The recommended flavor for Rose is a blend of strawberry, melon, citrus and flowers.
